# React Meme Generator

This website allows you to create meme in an instant!

### How to?

1. Choose a top and bottom text that you want to appear on the meme.

2. Make a suggestion for a background image, maybe it exists ;D

3. Hit enter or the generate Button and watch the magic unfold!

4. You can also download the image - it will directly appear in your default download folder.

### What happens behind the scenes:

This is a react training assignment. The website is rendered with react jsx components.

The three inputs are tied to states. With a click on the generate button or by hitting enter those three individual states are concatenated into one url that is being sent over to the memegen.link api.

Fortunately, the api is simple enough to just take any urls (with a certain structure) and make memes based on the in the info within the url.

Download: The download function is powered by a XMLHttpRequest. It gets the image-adress and loads the data into the default download folder of your browser.

# Happy meme-ing!
